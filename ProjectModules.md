# Transcendence Project Modules
##### Listed below are all the modules we have completed for ft_transcendence with links to the pages in the subject where they are specified and to relevent files in which the requirements are fulfilled. Major and minor modules are denoted by `Major` and `Minor` respectively.

### [Mandatory Part](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/118630/en.subject.pdf#page=5):

  - Frontend is pure vanilla Javascript (No libraries apart from `Bootstrap` and `ThreeJS`) => [Frontend module](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/118630/en.subject.pdf#page=12): `Bootstrap`, [Graphics module](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/118630/en.subject.pdf#page=24): `ThreeJS`
  - Website is a `single-page application` => verify this by going to various pages and looking at the network tab in developer the console (use back and forward buttons)
  - Works with Google Chrome (Check for other browsers)
  - There should be **NO WARNINGS OR ERRORS** when browsing

- [Game](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/118630/en.subject.pdf#page=7):
  - Both players should be able to use **the same keyboard** to play the Pong game => [Remote players module]() will only *"enhance"* this by adding remote players.

  - Protected aginst `SQL injections` + `XSS`
  - `HTTPS` for everything `ws` => `wss`
  - All user input should be **validated** in the backend (we can also implement frontend validation before backend validation for better UX)
  - **.env should not be stored publicly!**
